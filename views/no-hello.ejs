        <h1>No Hello</h1>
        <p class="legal-date">Please share your question right away instead of opening with a lonely greeting.</p>
        <h1>No Random Hellos</h1>
        <p class="legal-date">How to respect Ylsoo teammates' time and focus</p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-content">
        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>The pattern we try to avoid</h2>
          <div class="quote-block">
            <p><strong>You:</strong> Hello?</p>
            <p><strong>Teammate:</strong> <em>(now waiting, guessing what you might need)</em></p>
            <p><strong>You:</strong> Are you free? Can you jump on a call?</p>
            <p><strong>Teammate:</strong> I was focused on a deploy and had to stop to see if this was urgent.</p>
          </div>
          <p>That tiny pause between “hello” and the actual question is a productivity sink. Everyone—including the CEO—has to alt-tab away from deep work to check if they’re missing something important. Multiply that by dozens of chats a day and an entire team loses hours.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>Why it hurts more than it seems</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context switching costs time:</strong> Pulling someone out of flow for a context-free ping can take 20–30 minutes of recovery.</li>
            <li><strong>It creates social pressure:</strong> The recipient feels rude if they don’t reply immediately—even though there isn’t a question yet.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaders aren’t immune:</strong> Our CEO’s calendar is stacked. A vague greeting can derail the entire day while they wait for clarification.</li>
            <li><strong>Written records matter:</strong> Threads become impossible to search when they start with filler like “hi” or “quick question.”</li>
          <h2>Why we discourage pop-in greetings</h2>
          <p>We love friendly teammates, but focus time is precious. When someone receives a quick "hello" without any context, it interrupts their flow and forces them to guess what you might need. Multiply that across an entire team—and especially across leadership calendars—and those small interruptions add up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>What to do instead</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lead with context:</strong> Share your question or reason for reaching out right away so the person can respond efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Use async channels:</strong> Threads and project docs help everyone keep a record without needing an immediate response.</li>
            <li><strong>Be mindful of time zones:</strong> A well-structured message lets teammates reply when they’re online.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>Do this instead</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Lead with the ask.</strong> “Hey Mia — the billing job failed on shard 03. Can you restart it?”</li>
            <li><strong>Add relevant context.</strong> Include logs, screenshots, links, and deadlines so the reader can help asynchronously.</li>
            <li><strong>Mention urgency honestly.</strong> “Blocking launch” is clearer than “ASAP!!!” and lets people prioritize.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect availability.</strong> If you truly need a live conversation, propose times instead of demanding immediate attention.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Sending the full message upfront is considerate and lets the other person reply when they can, without a round of “hello” / “are you there?” limbo.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>When a greeting is totally fine</h2>
          <p>We’re not banning friendliness. A warm hello is perfect when it comes paired with substance, or when you’re already in a meeting, stand-up, social channel, or hallway chat. Just remember that in work chat, <strong>hello + question</strong> beats <strong>hello … (wait)</strong> every time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <h3>But what if I’m not sure the person is around?</h3>
          <p>Leave the message anyway. Most tools show presence indicators. The other person will see it when they return and answer with full context.</p>
          <h3>What if the CEO likes quick pings?</h3>
          <p>They still need the details. If it’s urgent, tag them with a short summary and what decision you need. If it’s not urgent, email or drop the notes in the appropriate channel.</p>
          <h3>Isn’t it rude to skip a greeting?</h3>
          <p>You can say “Hi!”—just follow it immediately with your request. Consider it the digital equivalent of “Hi, can I borrow you for 2 minutes about the SOC report?”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-footer">
          <p>Thanks for helping us keep Ylsoo courteous <em>and</em> efficient. Send context, save time, ship faster.</p>
          <h2>Protecting executive focus</h2>
          <p>Our CEO’s calendar is packed with strategic decisions, partner conversations, and team support. A surprise hello with no follow-up can derail that focus for the day. If you need input from the CEO or other executives, share a detailed note through the proper channels—include background, desired outcomes, and relevant timelines.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>When a quick greeting <em>is</em> welcome</h2>
          <p>We’re still humans! A warm greeting during scheduled meetings, team rituals, or social channels is always appreciated. Just pair it with purpose so we keep work flowing smoothly.</p>
